# Game_attemp_1
This is the first game I'm uploading.
The developer of this game is Brandon Robinson.

The Updates.txt file is for wanted updates in the future.

The main.py file is the game file.

The vars.py file is for storing all the vars.
(And I know I don't need to do that. It's just to keep it clean.)
